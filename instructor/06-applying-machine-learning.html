learning in a GLAM setting. We’ll move through the process of applying
machine learning step-by-step to make these stages easier to follow. In
reality, this process will rarely be completely linear and you likely
need to iterate on many steps of the process.</p>

These can range from projects with a relatively limited scope to
ambitious “end-to-end” applications of Machine Learning across core
infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is important that you have a clear idea of what your goal is in
applying Machine Learning. This could be a relatively open-ended goal of
’exploring what might be possible but sometimes you will have a much
more concrete outcome you are hoping to achieve.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>Machine learning models produce predictions. How we use these
predictions is a critical consideration when using Machine Learning. A
“perfect” model could be useless if the predictions it makes are used in
an inappropriate way and an “average” model might be beneficial if it is
carefully used within other workflows.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-predictions-to-actions.png" alt="Two possible ways of using Machine Learning Predictions" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Let’s look at an example to illustrate the predictions generated by a
machine learning model can be used very differently. For our example,
we’ll consider a machine learning model that takes some text as input
and predicts the language of that text. The predictions generated by
this model could be used:</p>
<ul><li>To directly create metadata for the language field for an item.</li>
<li>To show the language code as a suggestion to a human cataloguer who
can choose to use or ignore the suggestion.</li>
<li>To directly create the language code for a record if the model
‘confidence’ is above a certain level, and show it to a human cataloguer
if the prediction falls below a confidence threshold.</li>
<li>Show the predicted language and confidence score to the user of a
public catalogue system with a button allowing the user to indicate if
they think the prediction is correct or not.</li>
</ul><p>You can hopefully see from these examples that there are many
potential ways to utilise the predictions made by a machine learning
model. The way in which you decide to use the predictions of a model
will depend on many factors; existing infrastructure, staff attitudes
towards machine learning, user needs etc.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>As we saw in the previous episode data is of central importance for
developing Machine Learning models. The process involved in preparing
data for use in a machine learning project will depend on what you are
trying to achieve, the kind of machine learning you want to use but
there are some broad considerations that will apply in many
situations.</p>
<p>\ # TODO see where this data section fits in relation to the previous
episodes ?Maybe: Creating a smallish set for testing external methods
?Maybe: Creating a small test for the initial model training to
establish feasibility</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="choosing-a-metric-to-optimize">Choosing a metric to optimize<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-metric-to-optimize"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>In earlier episodes metrics were introduced as a way of tracking
model performance on a particular task. It is often recommended that
machine learning projects should focus on a particular, single metric to
optimise for. This will often be a certain accuracy score. If you are
working with very imbalanced data where some labels appear more
frequently you may choose another metric like f1-score instead. This
decision will really depend on the ‘business’ need you are addressing.
For example, if there will always be a ‘human in the loop’ you might
accept a lower accuracy score compared to a use case where model
predictions will be used directly. There may also be additional
considerations in the real world that aren’t captured by a headline
accuracy metric. This could include; how understandable your model’s
predictions are, how quickly a model is able to make predictions and how
easy a particular model is to implement.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="creating-a-baseline-could-your-machine-learning-model-be-a-regular-expression">Creating a baseline: could your machine learning model be a regular
expression?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-baseline-could-your-machine-learning-model-be-a-regular-expression"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>When deciding between different machine learning models it is often
useful to have a baseline that you can compare your results to. If you
read literature around machine learning models you will see that
performance is often reported on particular ‘benchmark’ datasets. The
performance on one of these benchmark datasets won’t always transfer to
other problems.</p>
<p>Creating a baseline approach helps to set a level of performance a
machine learning approach should be able to supersede. The most simple
baseline is to create a model which does some variation on guessing. For
example, you could assess the metrics you get when you make a prediction
proportional to how much that label appears in the training data. For
example, if you have a dataset that contains 70% of the image with the
label ‘cat’ and 30% ‘dog’ your baseline model would guess ‘cat’ 70% of
the time and ‘dog’ 30% of the time.</p>
<p>You might go beyond this and see if you can use a ‘rules-based
approach’ where you try and create a computer program that will make
predictions based on rules. For example, you might be able to create a
series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" class="external-link">regular
expressions</a> which matches particular text strings which you think
are likely to indicate the presence of a particular label. Carrying out
a baseline evaluation will give you a useful starting point of
comparison and will also help you confirm whether machine learning is
worth pursuing for your use case.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>We are now at the point in the process where we begin creating a
model. This is a vast topic which we can only scratch the surface of
here. We will focus on two particularly important decisions: whether to
use an existing model or to develop a new one for your task.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-model-choices.png" alt="Illustration of possible model choices" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="using-existing-models">Using existing models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-existing-models"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>There are various ways in which you can leverage existing machine
learning models. Some of these include using:</p>
<ul><li>machine learning models which are ‘deeply’ embedded into
applications. For example tools for performing OCR will often include
some machine learning-driven components.</li>
<li>machine-learning as an API service for example Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" class="external-link">Vision AI</a> that can be sent
data and will return a prediction.</li>
<li>models which have been trained on a particular task and can be used
‘out-of-the-box’ to make new predictions. For example using the Named
Entity Recognition from a Python Library like <a href="https://spacy.io/" class="external-link">spaCy</a>.</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of considerations that might influence whether you
use one of these systems. Some potential things to consider include;</p>
<ul><li>Easy of use: how easy is it to use the system to generate
predictions? Importantly how easy is it to use in your situation? For
example, an API might be easy to use on paper but if your organisation
doesn’t want data to leave local storage this option will be less
suitable.</li>
<li>Differences between models original training data and your data: the
training data used to train these existing models might be different
from your data. For example, a Named Entity Recognition tool might have
been trained on contemporary French, but you are planning to use it with
19th Century French. This may impact how well the model performs on your
data.</li>
<li>Cost: how much does the tool cost to use? Some of these existing
models are open source but there will still be costs involved in
applying these tools. Other tools may charge per prediction.</li>
<li>How much can you integrate the model: some of these tools will be
fully open-source with the developers happy to answer questions about
the models. Others are prosperity and it will sometimes be difficult to
know much about how the model was trained and where the model will do
less well.</li>
</ul><p>Having a small test set to work with will help make the process of
evaluating these options easier. It is also worth reaching out to other
institutions to build on existing lessons learned. We’ll outline some
resources for doing this in a future episode.</p>

other parts. Can probably drop quite a bit from this section.</p>
<p>An alternative to using existing models is to train your own models.
There are different ways of doing this:</p>
<p>‘Finetuning’ an existing model: this involves updating a previously
trained model with your data. For example, updating a Named Entity
Recognition model trained on modern French with training data for 19th
Century French. Training an existing model architecture from scratch: ??
Custom task architectures: ??</p>

<hr class="half-width"><figure><img src="../fig/05-using-model.png" alt="A simplified GLAM workflow" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once you have a machine learning model you are satisfied with you
will want to set up some way of using this model to create new
predictions on unseen data - usually, this is referred to as inference.
The processes behind making a model available for inference is often
referred to as ’deployment.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this workshop to cover all of the
considerations involved in this process. There is also a growing number
of tools and guidance related to deploying machine learning models that
can be drawn upon. There are some questions you should consider as you
think about:</p>
<ul><li>The user(s) of a model: who is going to be interacting with a
model?</li>
<li>Where is the data: where is the data you want to make predictions
on, is it easy/possible to move this or is it easier to bring the model
to the data?</li>
<li>Existing workflows: where does this model ‘sit’ within existing
workflows within your institutions? It might be easier to try to fit
your model within this workflow rather than introducing a new machine
learning approach at the same time as changing an existing
workflow.</li>
<li>Existing IT infrastructure: what is a realistic approach to using a
model inside your existing infrastructure? A lot of the guidance on
deployment takes for granted that you have access to a cloud service but
this will not be the case for all GLAM institutions.</li>

<hr class="half-width"><p>Now you have created a model and have some way of using it you may be
hoping that the journey is over. However, if you plan to continue to use
your model there are certain things that are important to watch out
for.</p>
<p><strong>Safety checks:</strong> You may want to perform some ‘safety
checks’ on your model’s predictions. This may be particularly important
if you use a pre-trained model where you didn’t have as much control
over the possible labels a model chooses. Some labels which might be
benign in some situations can become offensive when attached to
inappropriate items. For example, if you have an archive that includes
wartime photographs a picture of a bomb explosion might be labelled as
‘fireworks’ or ‘celebration’ by a computer vision model. These safety
checks are particularly important when the material is sensitive and is
another reason why it is important to have a team that thinks critically
about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Data Drift</strong>: A particularly important challenge you
may potentially face is ‘data drift’. As we saw in previous episodes the
data a model is trained on has a big impact on the predictions made by
that model. Over time the data we ask our model to make predictions for
may change from the data we originally used to train the model. This can
lead to the predictions of your model becoming less accurate over
time.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">An example of data drift</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>You trained a model to predict how many ‘no-shows’ you get each hour
for pre-booked exhibitions to your museums. You use this model to help
you decide how many extra tickets you can sell at the door. At some
point, your model’s predictions are often wrong and you are frequently
overcapacity in the exhibition space.</p>
<p>After a few days of trying to dig into what is happening, you realise
that your museum now has a mobile app it didn’t previously have. This
app is being used by many people to buy tickets a few minutes before the
exhibition to avoid queuing. Digging into the data you can see that
currently the average time a ticket is purchased before a timed
exhibition visit is an hour. Looking back at your original training data
the average time was 3 days before. The models training data is
different from the ‘real world’ in which we ask the model to make
predictions. In this case, the change was quite obvious but you could
think of other changes which could impact this model, the season in
which the training data came from, the price of exhibition tickets
etc.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p><strong>Monitoring predictions</strong>: if you plan to use your
model on an ongoing basis it may be helpful to monitor the predictions
it makes. If you notice a big shift in the distribution of labels being
predicted over time you may want to investigate if this is because of a
change in the data being shown to the model. This may not always be
possible to do automatically. So sometimes human checks may be more
practical.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping a human in the loop</strong>: In an earlier section,
we discussed how the predictions made by machine learning models could
be used in a variety of ways. Some of these involved a human checking or
using the model’s prediction. This approach will be likely to help you
spot issues with models predictions. Even if you are using the model’s
predictions to make automated changes you may still want to ’insert a
human into the loop to check these predictions fairly regularly. This
may also be an important stage in developing buy-in for machine learning
based approaches within an institution.</p>
<p><strong>Retraining a model</strong>: in some situations a model won’t
just be trained once. You may want to retrain the model when the type of
data changes or you have more training data that can be used. One
typical example of this kind of process is models which predict some
metrics for each quarter. After that quarter has passed you will have
‘ground truth’ data available that you will likely want to use in your
model. Another source of training data might be generated by having a
human in the loop. If a model is showing predictions to a human who can
accept or reject these predictions this gives you additional examples
your model can learn from.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<ul><li>Machine learning projects involve many considerations beyond
training a model.</li>
<li>The predictions made by the same machine learning model can be
‘translated’ into actions in different ways. The extent to which you
‘automate’ decisions versus keeping a ‘human-in-the-loop’ will depend on
the problem you are tackling, your organization and your model’s
performance.</li>
<li>The use of Machine learning by GLAMs is relatively new. Sharing
results and lessons learned will likely help GLAMS realize the potential
benefits of machine learning.</li>
