<hr class="half-width">
<p>The field of Artificial Intelligence has been around since the 1950s
(<a href="https://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf" class="external-link">Dartmouth
Conference, 1956</a>). It is a broad topic which encompasses a number of
sub-fields including but not limited to: Logic, Probability, Knowledge
Representation, and Machine Learning.</p>
<p>This figure shows how a system based on Artificial Intelligence might
function:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ep-02-ai-graph.png" alt="AI process" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The system accepts an input, performs some inference about what the
input represents, performs some reasoning about the inferences made
based on prior knowledge, and finally decides on an action.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="from-logic-to-learning">From logic to learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-logic-to-learning"></a>
</h3>
<p>The history of Logic stretches all the way back to The Organon of
Aristotle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon" class="external-link">Organon</a>)
and was formalised as a mathematical discipline by George Boole in the
19th century (hence the name Boolean Logic). With logic we can write
rules to reason about data or make decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>It is</strong> raining therefore I will carry an
umbrella”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logical rules are based on things being True or False but the world
is not so clear cut. Probability lets us add doubt and uncertainty:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It <strong>might</strong> rain today, should I take an
umbrella?”.</li>
</ul>
<p>With logical rules and probability we can solve quite complex tasks,
but there are limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Which paintings in our collection have umbrellas in them?”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a minute to think of how you would describe an umbrella using a
set of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>What colour is it?</li>
<li>What shape is it?</li>
<li>How big is it?</li>
<li>What difference does it make if it is up or down?</li>
<li>Is a parasol an umbrella?</li>
</ul>
<p>Describing something as intuitively simple as an umbrella is
difficult because although we have a rough conceptual idea there isn’t a
fixed physical description. Even if you break it into component parts
you still need to define them - what is a handle? what is a canopy? It
becomes even more complicated if you try to specify the description in a
way that a computer can interpret. Thankfully Machine Learning can come
to our rescue.</p>

<p>There are four types of machine learning, and in this lesson we will
focus on the first two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised - the system is given data that is categorised and
labeled and asked to learn by example to make predictions on totally new
data it has never seen before</li>
<li>Unsupervised - given data that has not been categorised and labeled
and asked to put it into groups (find patterns) without guidance</li>
<li>Semi-supervised - a combination of supervised and unsupervised</li>
<li>Reinforcement - learns about the world by interacting with its
environment (example: self-driving cars and <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" class="external-link">AlphaGo</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary task of Machine Learning is prediction.</p>
<p>A prediction may be a numerical value: how much will temperature
control in the archive cost if we have a hot summer? how many days will
library borrowers keep books for? Or it may be a classification or
label: which paintings are of animals/architecture/people? which
documents should be classified as sensitive?</p>

<p>Predicting a numerical value is known as Regression. The term
Regression was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe
a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of
descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal
average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean). (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis#:~:text=The%20term%20%22regression%22%20was%20coined,as%20regression%20toward%20the%20mean" class="external-link">Regression

<p>Imagine you want to go on holiday next month. Imagine! You would like
to know what the temperature will be on a small island that has no
weather information. To do this you find the following information about
other countries around the world: latitude, longitude, month, average
temperature. Now you can use a machine learning technique called
Regression to predict the temperature at your potential destination
using its lat/lon and the month. This is a prediction task.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to make a list of destinations you
like, and those you don’t like. Gather the same information of lat/lon,
month and temperature for a sample of countries, but this time add a
‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for whether you like them or not. You can now choose one
of many machine learning classification algorithms to label the rest of
the world’s countries Yes or No. This is a binary (there are two
categories) classification task.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The previous example was of supervised learning. In the supervised
scenario a set of labelled examples are passed to a machine learning
classifier which learns to identify relationships between features of
the data and the labels, or a numerical output. The table shows some
examples of features and labels for some supervised learning tasks:</p>

<p>Unsupervised learning is not given any examples. Instead a target is
suggested and the algorithm groups the data based on that target. The
target is usually the number of groups wanted, and the algorithm will
place data points into each group in order to maximum the similarity of
group members. The following activity aims to give you an intuition for
clustering, a commonly used form of unsupervised learning.</p>

<p>There isn’t a right answer to this challenge. In fact an algorithm
with no other information other than the words above would probably
distribute them randomly. To perform the task it would need further
information that could provide semantic relationships between the words.
That may it could establish that sport is similar to football, rugby and
cricket, and fine dining and cooking are related. Without that
information they are just meaningless strings to a computer. You should
have seen that there are multiple solutions and when using unsupervised
methods you have little influence over which is chosen.</p>

<p>Each paradigm has its advantages and disadvantages. Unsupervised
learning is a straightforward way of identifying clusters of similar
records in a set of data making it ideal for gaining a high level view
of a new dataset. However, choosing the right number of clusters can be
difficult and there is no way to control the criteria for how clusters
are formed. In the above exercise we saw a number of types of activity
(physical, food related, current affairs, natural world), with some
possibly fitting into two categories. In supervised learning we define
the categories in advance giving us control over the outputs. The
downside is the cost of labelling our data. Consider the effort involved
in the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transcribing 100 pages of handwritten medieval documents</li>
<li>Tagging each of 10000 images if they contain an umbrella</li>
<li>Linking together daily visitor data with weather data currently held
on someone else’s website</li>

<p>There is a lot of jargon and terminology in Machine Learning, and it
can be confusing to a newcomer especially when some terms have more than
one meaning. The term <strong>model</strong> is one such example. In
this episode we will present two definitions of model, and also
introduce the term <strong>algorithm</strong>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="modelling-the-world">Modelling the world<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#modelling-the-world"></a>
</h3>
<p>Whether the task is prediction or classification, the method
supervised or unsupervised, the underlying principle is one of modelling
the world through data.</p>
<p>We as humans are making models all the time. A quick look out the
window and our in-built weather model, learned from past soakings, helps
us make the umbrella decision. At school we learned one of the simplest
models for numerical data - the average. An average is an example of a
<strong>conceptual model</strong>, a generalised way to describe a real
world process. In this case it represents the typical value in some
population. To apply this model to a real world problem we need data and
an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Working within the constraints of the
conceptual model the algorithm will adjust a set of numerical
<strong>parameters</strong> until it achieves the best it can against
some optimisation target. It uses the data to help achieve this goal.
The final values of the parameters when the target is met are a
<strong>trained model</strong>. The trained model provides a
mathematical process for converting an input to an output.</p>
<p>If I were to try to guess the height of the next person to walk
through the door, the average would be a good <strong>conceptual
model</strong> to use. The <strong>algorithm</strong> that you probably
learned as a child is to add up all the heights and then divide by the
number of measurements. If the data we had available was heights of 19
year old Finnish people then the <strong>trained model</strong> would,
given any input, return a value of 173.5cm (according to Wikipedia)
.</p>
<p>It will be wrong a lot of the time but it will be the best single
parameter model available. A famous aphorism in the statistical and
machine learning communities says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All models are wrong, some are useful” - George Box (1976)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In machine learning we have lots of models to choose from, and
choosing a model depends on the type of data, the amount of data, the
purpose, and a certain amount of pragmatism.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We want to predict online shop visitors based on the number of
marketing tweets about the shop sent out in a month</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Assuming a straight line relationship, we need a model with two
<strong>parameters</strong>. The first parameter is the expected
visitors when there are no tweets sent. The second is the slope - how
much visitors increases (or decreases) with each tweet.</li>
<li>The <strong>conceptual model</strong> is a <strong>linear
model</strong>, and with a few past examples of visitor numbers and
tweets, we can use the <strong>least squares algorithm</strong> to find
the parameters which best predict the effect of increased tweets. The
<strong>trained model</strong> consists of the two parameters and a
formula using them to convert tweets into visitors.</li>
<li>A straight line only goes in one direction. In reality we would
expect the data to plateau out, or even decline, after a certain number
of tweets. We might say that the model <strong>underfits</strong> the
data, it is too simplistic. A model with an extra parameter or two would
better capture the diminishing returns. If we used a model with 100
parameters it would find the exact relationship between tweets and
visitors in the training data but it wouldn’t generalise well to new
data. We call this <strong>overfitting</strong>.</li>
<li>With very little training data available the simpler model may
perform better because there isn’t enough to learn a more complex
relationship from.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>In machine learning we always work with two sets of data. The
training data is used to train the model, the testing data is used to
verify whether the model will generalise to unseen data. It is important
that the training data and testing data are both representative of the
real world data we will use our model against in an application but they
must not overlap with each other. The process of training a model is
often called the <strong>Data Science Lifecycle</strong>. It is an
iterative process of finding the best model using training data. The
very end of this process is when the test data is used, and often in
competitive situations (e.g. an academic competition, or private
companies competing for a tender) the test data is not seen by the data
scientists at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We want to translate Medieval Latin text into English</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In this case we need a <strong>conceptual model</strong> which maps
one sequence (a Latin sentence), to another (an English sentence). The
<strong>trained model</strong> may be a neural network which consists of
millions of parameters stored in matrices. These parameters are
necessary to capture all the nuances of language translation. The
<strong>algorithm</strong> used will most likely be <strong>gradient
descent</strong> which is an efficient method of adjusting millions of
parameters as training data is fed through the algorithm. What the
algorithm does is find the parameter values which best map input to
output, with best meaning the ones which make the fewest mistakes.</li>
<li>With millions of parameters we need thousands or millions of
training examples. This has both a human cost in creating the training
data, and a computational (energy) cost</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="explainable-ai">Explainable AI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#explainable-ai"></a>
</h3>
<p>One important consideration when choosing a model may be to do with
explaining results. In the first scenario, above, we can explain the
whole model. “Every time we send a tweet, online visitors increase by
…”. In the Latin translation scenario we can’t describe the model in
those terms. However, we may be able to see which word(s) in the input
were most influential in deciding each word in the output. This is known
as <strong>Explainable AI</strong> and is a big topic in the fields of
AI and Human Computer Interaction. In some scenarios it may be essential
to be able to explain exactly why a decision was made, so a model which
allows us to spell out the exact calculation has to be used. This may
involve losing out on the more accurate results of a model that can not
be explained. Explainable AI aims to remove the need for such
compromises. As well as explaining individual decisions we need to
understand the behaviour of our model on a more systemic level. The
episode on bias will address the issues we face when this is not done
correctly.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Although a lot is said about algorithms when discussing machine
learning, the data is the most important part. A model trained on 19
year olds will be no good at predicting the heights of primary school
children. Machine learning algorithms expect numerical inputs but we can
have a lot of influence in how those inputs are derived and even add in
our own knowledge.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="feature-engineering">Feature engineering<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-engineering"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the trends seen in machine learning, especially in the field
of <strong>deep learning</strong> is that the more training data
available, the better the results, and the more complex problems can be
solved. While this is true, it is not helpful if you don’t have much
training data available and need to work with simpler conceptual models
but still want to solve complex problems.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to use expert domain knowledge of the data to
augment it with additional features. This process is known as
<strong>Feature engineering</strong>. As a worked example, we will
consider a column of dates. To a computer a date (without the time
portion) is a sequential number which represents the number of days
since a certain fixed point in time (e.g. 1st January 1970). As a number
it doesn’t contain any of the periodic information that a date in other
formats does. As domain experts we can add some insight to the machine
learning process by representing a date in different ways.</p>
<p>If my task was to predict visitor numbers to a museum I might convert
a date to a weekday/weekend indicator, or match it to a school holiday
calendar. The following diagram shows several different representations
of the same date:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ep-02-date_feature_engineering.png" alt="Date representations" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="embeddings">Embeddings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#embeddings"></a>
</h3>
<p>Machine Learning algorithms require numerical inputs, which often
means we need to convert our data into numerical form. In the case of
text this can be problematic. One option is have each word as a feature
but then our model can only use words appearing in the training data.
Also we lose the semantic nature of words - for example, the words car
and automobile are treated as independent features. Word embeddings
allow us to capture relationships between words by placing them in a
large multi-dimensional (numerical) space, such that words with similar
meanings are in some way closer to each other. The multi-dimensional
nature allows for the multiple meanings of many words. For example, Date
is a representation of time, a fruit, and an evening out with
dinner.</p>
<p>To illustrate creating word embeddings, here is a simple two
dimensional representation of different fruits. Each fruit is
represented by two numbers: their ‘roundness’, and their colour on a
‘rainbow’ scale (Red=0.0, Violet=1.0). In reality we wouldn’t define the
dimensions, and they wouldn’t be interpretable in this way. Now if we
wanted to represent Kiwi numerically it would be [0.7,0.5]. We also see
that Banana is most similar to Lemon, so perhaps we would need to add a
‘Citrus’ dimension for a better representation.</p>

with tabular data, and they all have strengths and weaknesses for

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Computer Vision (often abbreviated to CV) has been around since the
early days of AI but has been revolutionised in recent years by so
called Deep Learning models. The most common of these models is called a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and is capable of identifying complex
patterns in images. A <strong>convolution</strong> is inspired by our
own visual system. Imagine you are travelling at high speed and trying
to avoid obstacles. Your visual system doesn’t have time to work out the
fine details of the objects in front of you, it just needs to detect
shapes. Convolutions work in that way too. One convolution may detect
horizontal edges, another vertical edges, yet another corners, and so
on. They work over very small portions of an image, as little as 3x3
pixel squares. A <strong>neural network</strong> is a complex machine
learning model which we use when we need to go beyond drawing lines
between points (although they can do that too). It is built of layers of
numbers and data is passed through the layers until an answer of some
sort comes out of the other end. In a CNN the first layer find the
edges, the second layer starts to find patterns of connected edges, the
third layer may start to detect shapes, and we keep going until the
final layer when a classification is decided on based on all the
patterns found in the image. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (quite
a mouthful) is just the name for a CNN with lots of layers (there can be
hundreds). The deeper the network, the more complex features it can
identify in an image - from edges, to shapes, to patterns, to textures.
However, as we learned in the linear model section, complexity comes at
a cost. A deep network may need to see millions of labelled images to
perform well, and they can take many hours, days, or even weeks to
train.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In Computer Vision we started with a grid of numbers which is the way
that images are represented in a computer. Machine Learning algorithms
need numerical inputs which means that before we can work with text we
need to convert it into a numerical form. This means there are two
stages to modelling our data, each introducing assumptions about the
world which impact the tasks we can accomplish, and the computational
and data resource needed to accomplish them.</p>
<p>Stage one is to model the words in our text. The simplest way is to
build a vocabulary and then count how many times each word in the
vocabulary appears in each document. The vocabulary is generally built
from the training corpus because the classifier needs at least one
example of each word. In recent years state of the art systems have used
a representation of words called <strong>word embeddings</strong>.
Conceptually embeddings are numerical representations of words which
allow us to find semantically similar words. This means that if our
training corpus contains the words ‘tree’, ‘plant’ and ‘flower’, then
applying the model to a document containing the word ‘bush’ will still
work even though it wasn’t in the training corpus. Word embeddings are
often trained on a very large corpus of documents (e.g. Wikipedia) and
made publicly available. While this is convenient it is important to
bear in mind that the documents they’re trained on may not be
representative of the language encountered in historical documents.</p>
<p>The second stage is to model the language. This doesn’t mean creating
a complex linguistic model, but thinking about simplifying assumptions
about the text to reduce computational complexity. The simplest language
model considers all words in a sentence to be independent of each
other.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think that is a reasonable assumption?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were formulating a theory of language it would be a bad
assumption, as it suggests sentences are random sets of words. However,
for many real world machine learning tasks it works quite well. The term
<strong>bag of words</strong> is often used to describe such a model.
One way of thinking of this model of language is to imagine writing a
review of a book. In front of you are two bags, one marked ‘Positive’
and the other ‘Negative’. If you like the book you will reach into the
‘Positive’ bag for words to use in your review, and if you don’t like it
then you choose words from the ‘Negative’ bag. Now a Machine Learning
algorithm trying to learn a model for identifying whether reviews are
positive or negative is effectively trying to establish which bag the
words in the review came from. The reviews containing words like
‘Interesting’, ‘Exciting’, ‘Delightful’ are more likely to be positive,
while ‘Boring’ and ‘Uninteresting’ would suggest the negative bag was
used. The simplicity of the model allows us to use less training data
and would be computationally efficient to build a model.</p>
<p>Of course we know that language is more nuanced than that.</p>
<ul>
<li>“The book was not boring at all” - this sentence is positive despite
the word ‘boring’ appearing in it.</li>
<li>“The author’s other books were exciting but this was not” - this
sentence is negative despite containing ‘exciting’</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case we can increase the complexity of our language model to
use pairs of words, which would mean ‘not boring’ becomes a feature in
the input data. However, remember that whenever we increase complexity
we generally need more data.</p>
<p>Modern deep learning models are able to model sentences, or even
paragraphs and documents, as strings of related words. This is essential
for tasks such as machine translation where word order changes between
languages. It is also necessary if we want the machine to make sense of
long passages where perhaps the subject of the sentence was mentioned at
the beginning but is referred to by a pronoun later on in the
document.</p>
<ul>
<li>Otto met Nancy at the park. It was a beautiful sunny day and he was
looking forward to their picnic together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kind of machine learning model needed to make the connection
between ‘their’ and ‘Otto and Nancy’ is called a <strong>Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN)</strong>. Recurrent just means that it models its
inputs as a sequence and is able to make connections between items in
the sequence. As always, there is a trade off. Complex deep learning
models require a lot of training data, millions of lines of text to
perform well. This makes sense because to identify relationships between
words it must see examples of words used in different contexts.</p>

<p>One of the state of the art applications of machine learning seen in
cultural heritage at the moment is Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR).
The idea is to convert digitised handwritten documents into searchable
and machine readable text. To achieve this HTR uses a combination of
Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. A Convolutional Neural
Network is used to work out the letter shapes in each word. Since
handwriting can be tricky and ambiguous the best it can do is identify
possible letters from the shapes it has identified. A Recurrent Neural
Network is then used to work out the most likely word. Since it has a
sentence level language model it does this by taking into account words
in the whole line of text so that it can use context to work out the
most likely word. By balancing the prediction of the Computer Vision
model with the language model it is still able to output words that were
never seen in the training data.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Though AI and machine learning (ML) systems may appear to us as
objective, dealing solely in facts and numbers, free from troublesome
human proclivities in their decision making, there are abundant
opportunities for human bias to enter ML systems at all stages of the
pipeline.</p>
<p>Human bias can have a broad and complex range of effects on the
classification and predictions of models, with consequences of varying
degrees. Bias in AI can be understood in most general terms as an error
where incorrect assumptions lead to systematically prejudiced
results.</p>
<p>When we typically hear about bias in AI these days, particularly in
the news, it is most often presented and understood in the context of
societal prejudice and discrimination, where human prejudice in the
development and application of algorithms results in the perpetuation of
unfairness, inequities, and stereotypes of the real world.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_policing" class="external-link">Predictive
policing systems</a> are a canonical illustration of this. Such systems
are being relied upon as tools for courts to use in sentencing, aiming
to predict the likelihood of defendants committing a future crime.
Analysis by ProPublica in 2016 of one system used widely throughout the
United States, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for
Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) tool, uncovered significant racial
disparity between the system predictions for white and black defendants.
The COMPAS tool assigns scores from 1 to 10 to a defendent based on 100
or so factors such as age, sex and criminal history (although notably
race has been excluded). While overall, “Northpointe’s assessment tool
correctly predicts recidivism 61 percent of the time…blacks are almost
twice as likely as whites to be labeled a higher risk but not actually
re-offend. It makes the opposite mistake among whites: They are much
more likely than blacks to be labeled lower risk but go on to commit
other crimes. (Source: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing" class="external-link">ProPublica
analysis of data from Broward County, Fla.</a>)”. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/equivant-compas-algorithm/550646/" class="external-link">a
subsequent study</a> has revealed that the COMPAS tool was actually no
better at predicting crimes than random people on the internet.</p>
<p>Bias may exist in other forms, such as an image dataset that
inadvertently contains objects that always happen to appear in the
center of the image, making it hard for a classifier to recognise
objects that are not in the center of images.</p>
<p>Bias may even be introduced to an algorithm in order to correct an
unfair model. Consider an image search algorithm, based on real world
data where a majority of men are CEOs. A user searching for “CEO” will
find images of primarily men, and a good bias may be introduced in order
to insure proper representation of a diversity of CEOs.</p>
<p>In whatever form it takes, and we’ll cover more of these forms in
this episode, it is crucial for model builders to be able to identify
bias and manage it.</p>

<td>Prejudice bias</td>
<td>Arises when data incorporates cultural, race, gender or stereotypes
it should be ignorant of</td>
<td>A model is designed to differentiate between men and women in a
museum’s photograph collection. The training data contains more pictures
of women in kitchens than men in kitchens, or more pictures of men
coding than women, then the algorithm is trained to make incorrect
inferences about the gender of people engaged in those activities due to
prejudices that occur in the real world, represented in the data.</td>

<td>Selection bias</td>
<td>Introduced by the selection of individuals, groups or data for
analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved,
thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the
population intended to be analyzed</td>
<td>A model is trained to predict future sales of a new product line for
the museum gift shop. To build the training set, the first 200
subscribers to the museum’s newsletter were offered a small gift voucher
to fill in a survey. Instead of randomly targeting consumers, the
dataset targets newsletter subscribers who don’t necessarily represent
the museum’s potential paying customers. It’s entirely possible the
newsletter subscribers population may be more inclined to be signed up
to learn about free events and giveaways, while typical consumers may
not be enticed by small gift vouchers or even signed up at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Confirmation bias</td>
<td>In the process of refining and reinforcing a models learning,
unconsciously or consciously processing data in ways that confirm
preexisting beliefs and hypotheses.</td>
<td>An engineer is building a model that predicts aggressiveness in dogs
based on a variety of features (height, weight, breed, environment). The
engineer had an unpleasant encounter with a hyperactive toy poodle as a
child, and ever since has associated the breed with aggression. When the
trained model predicted most toy poodles to be relatively docile, the
engineer retrained the model several more times until it produced a
result showing smaller poodles to be more violent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Correlation bias</td>
<td>Correlation is not causation. Correlation implies the mutual
relation, covariation, or association between two or more variables. It
only questions whether the variable varies together or not.</td>
<td>The height of the father and his children is correlated, but one
can’t say that the father’s height is caused by determining his
children’s height on the only assumption of the hereditary factor. There
are several other factors present such as environment, genetics,
etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Exclusion bias</td>
<td>Removing data from a set that we think isn’t relevant</td>
<td>For example, imagine you have a dataset of customer sales in America
and Canada. 98% of the customers are from America, so you choose to
delete the location data thinking it is irrelevant. However, this means
your model will not pick up on the fact that your Canadian customers
spend two times more.</td>

<p>“It’s all too easy to forget that data is about human beings and
their behaviors. Data is not an abstraction…Data encodes the stories of
our lives, capturing not only our tastes and interests but also our
hopes and fears. Data isn’t an abstract idea or a set of numbers or
qualitative responses. It can be and is, ultimately, human.
(reference)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data is never neutral. It is collected, managed, and organised by and
about people. And the manner in which data is sourced and constructed
for training sets will have important implications on your model’s
output. In the simplest example, if you are aiming to build a face
recognition software but only train your model on a dataset of white
faces, your model is obviously going to struggle to identify faces of
any other colour.</p>
<p>Because of the many complexities around copyright and licensing,
privacy issues and high costs involved in getting access to large
quantities of quality datasets, data scientists have favoured scraping
what they can find freely, en masse and indiscriminately, across the
internet from free sources such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/datasets/wikipedia-xml-data/" class="external-link">Wikipedia</a>,
FlickR or Google News. Datasets collected in this manner, taken without
intervention, will reflect the biases of these sources, such as a
certain demographic composition (overrepresentation of young internet
users from developed countries for example).</p>
<p>When training data is labelled (annotated), typically through some
kind of crowdsourcing mechanism such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, and as
we saw in the first activity, bias can crop up, either consciously or
unconsciously, in the course of this. Whether personally undertaking or
crowdsourcing your data annotation, it’s important to be aware of how
different demographics and social constructs may introduce bias and
implicit associations into your pipeline.</p>
<p>GLAM staff will be more than familiar with this phenomenon as we

bias in library and archives descriptions</a>. As demand for GLAM
collections and catalogue data for use in machine learning increases, it
is vital that model builders are made aware of the biases that may be
encoded within cultural heritage data.</p>

<p>We’ve talked a lot about bias that can make it into our training
data, but this isn’t the only way it manifests itself in machine
learning systems. As we now know from earlier in this lesson, machine
learning models are refined and reinforced based on reactions to its
results. In this process, there is a risk of certain outcomes being
ignored and others privileged over others, skewing a models
learning.</p>
<p>For example, A model builder is using named entity recognition across
multilingual newspapers. They might determine they are satisfied when
the model gets to 90% accuracy and will aim to improve to this result.
However this overall accuracy can hide the fact that some particular
‘slices’ of our data might have much worse accuracy. Your overall
accuracy might be very good but your model may underperform on one
language. This might not be addressed by changing your data but changing
how you approach training and evaluating your model.</p>

</h3>
<p>This may be an area you might already have some awareness of as the
ubiquity of machine learning systems in our lives increases, the effects
of unfair, biased algorithms are starting to become more apparent.
Algorithmic bias is defined as unjust, unfair, or prejudicial treatment
of people related to race, income, sexual orientation, religion, gender,
and other characteristics historically associated with discrimination
and marginalization, when and where they manifest in algorithmic systems
and algorithmically aided decision-making. Predictive policing as
covered earlier is probably the most clear example of algorithmic bias.
#TODO: add Amazon hiring example. Another canonical example of this is
the Amazon hiring</p>
<p>It is imperative to be aware then that the manner in which data is
collected, annotated and results applied, will have far reaching
consequences for society as decisions produced by ML systems are
increasingly being relied upon in real world scenarios. From seemingly
benign systems like recommendation engines to predictive policing,
opportunities for ML systems to perpetuate and amplify humans bias and
inequality abound.</p>

<p>In this episode, we turn to the question of how we can apply machine
learning in a GLAM setting. We’ll move through the process of applying
machine learning step-by-step to make these stages easier to follow. In
reality, this process will rarely be completely linear and you likely

<p>There are many possible uses of Machine Learning in a GLAM context.
These can range from projects with a relatively limited scope to
ambitious “end-to-end” applications of Machine Learning across core
infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is important that you have a clear idea of what your goal is in
applying Machine Learning. This could be a relatively open-ended goal of
’exploring what might be possible but sometimes you will have a much
more concrete outcome you are hoping to achieve.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Machine learning models produce predictions. How we use these
predictions is a critical consideration when using Machine Learning. A
“perfect” model could be useless if the predictions it makes are used in
an inappropriate way and an “average” model might be beneficial if it is
carefully used within other workflows.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/05-predictions-to-actions.png" alt="Two possible ways of using Machine Learning Predictions" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Let’s look at an example to illustrate the predictions generated by a
machine learning model can be used very differently. For our example,
we’ll consider a machine learning model that takes some text as input
and predicts the language of that text. The predictions generated by
this model could be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To directly create metadata for the language field for an item.</li>
<li>To show the language code as a suggestion to a human cataloguer who
can choose to use or ignore the suggestion.</li>
<li>To directly create the language code for a record if the model
‘confidence’ is above a certain level, and show it to a human cataloguer
if the prediction falls below a confidence threshold.</li>
<li>Show the predicted language and confidence score to the user of a
public catalogue system with a button allowing the user to indicate if
they think the prediction is correct or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can hopefully see from these examples that there are many
potential ways to utilise the predictions made by a machine learning
model. The way in which you decide to use the predictions of a model
will depend on many factors; existing infrastructure, staff attitudes
towards machine learning, user needs etc.</p>

<p>As we saw in the previous episode data is of central importance for
developing Machine Learning models. The process involved in preparing
data for use in a machine learning project will depend on what you are

there are some broad considerations that will apply in many
situations.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In earlier episodes metrics were introduced as a way of tracking
model performance on a particular task. It is often recommended that
machine learning projects should focus on a particular, single metric to
optimise for. This will often be a certain accuracy score. If you are
working with very imbalanced data where some labels appear more
frequently you may choose another metric like f1-score instead. This
decision will really depend on the ‘business’ need you are addressing.
For example, if there will always be a ‘human in the loop’ you might
accept a lower accuracy score compared to a use case where model
predictions will be used directly. There may also be additional
considerations in the real world that aren’t captured by a headline
accuracy metric. This could include; how understandable your model’s
predictions are, how quickly a model is able to make predictions and how
easy a particular model is to implement.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="creating-a-baseline-could-your-machine-learning-model-be-a-regular-expression">Creating a baseline: could your machine learning model be a regular
expression?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-baseline-could-your-machine-learning-model-be-a-regular-expression"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When deciding between different machine learning models it is often
useful to have a baseline that you can compare your results to. If you
read literature around machine learning models you will see that
performance is often reported on particular ‘benchmark’ datasets. The
performance on one of these benchmark datasets won’t always transfer to
other problems.</p>
<p>Creating a baseline approach helps to set a level of performance a
machine learning approach should be able to supersede. The most simple
baseline is to create a model which does some variation on guessing. For
example, you could assess the metrics you get when you make a prediction
proportional to how much that label appears in the training data. For
example, if you have a dataset that contains 70% of the image with the
label ‘cat’ and 30% ‘dog’ your baseline model would guess ‘cat’ 70% of
the time and ‘dog’ 30% of the time.</p>
<p>You might go beyond this and see if you can use a ‘rules-based
approach’ where you try and create a computer program that will make
predictions based on rules. For example, you might be able to create a
series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" class="external-link">regular
expressions</a> which matches particular text strings which you think
are likely to indicate the presence of a particular label. Carrying out
a baseline evaluation will give you a useful starting point of
comparison and will also help you confirm whether machine learning is
worth pursuing for your use case.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We are now at the point in the process where we begin creating a
model. This is a vast topic which we can only scratch the surface of
here. We will focus on two particularly important decisions: whether to
use an existing model or to develop a new one for your task.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are various ways in which you can leverage existing machine
learning models. Some of these include using:</p>
<ul>
<li>machine learning models which are ‘deeply’ embedded into
applications. For example tools for performing OCR will often include
some machine learning-driven components.</li>
<li>machine-learning as an API service for example Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" class="external-link">Vision AI</a> that can be sent
data and will return a prediction.</li>
<li>models which have been trained on a particular task and can be used
‘out-of-the-box’ to make new predictions. For example using the Named
Entity Recognition from a Python Library like <a href="https://spacy.io/" class="external-link">spaCy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of considerations that might influence whether you
use one of these systems. Some potential things to consider include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy of use: how easy is it to use the system to generate
predictions? Importantly how easy is it to use in your situation? For
example, an API might be easy to use on paper but if your organisation
doesn’t want data to leave local storage this option will be less
suitable.</li>
<li>Differences between models original training data and your data: the
training data used to train these existing models might be different
from your data. For example, a Named Entity Recognition tool might have
been trained on contemporary French, but you are planning to use it with
19th Century French. This may impact how well the model performs on your
data.</li>
<li>Cost: how much does the tool cost to use? Some of these existing
models are open source but there will still be costs involved in
applying these tools. Other tools may charge per prediction.</li>
<li>How much can you integrate the model: some of these tools will be
fully open-source with the developers happy to answer questions about
the models. Others are prosperity and it will sometimes be difficult to
know much about how the model was trained and where the model will do
less well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a small test set to work with will help make the process of
evaluating these options easier. It is also worth reaching out to other
institutions to build on existing lessons learned. We’ll outline some
resources for doing this in a future episode.</p>

<p>Now you have created a model and have some way of using it you may be
hoping that the journey is over. However, if you plan to continue to use
your model there are certain things that are important to watch out
for.</p>
<p><strong>Safety checks:</strong> You may want to perform some ‘safety
checks’ on your model’s predictions. This may be particularly important
if you use a pre-trained model where you didn’t have as much control
over the possible labels a model chooses. Some labels which might be
benign in some situations can become offensive when attached to
inappropriate items. For example, if you have an archive that includes
wartime photographs a picture of a bomb explosion might be labelled as
‘fireworks’ or ‘celebration’ by a computer vision model. These safety
checks are particularly important when the material is sensitive and is
another reason why it is important to have a team that thinks critically
about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Data Drift</strong>: A particularly important challenge you
may potentially face is ‘data drift’. As we saw in previous episodes the
data a model is trained on has a big impact on the predictions made by
that model. Over time the data we ask our model to make predictions for
may change from the data we originally used to train the model. This can
lead to the predictions of your model becoming less accurate over
time.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">An example of data drift</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>You trained a model to predict how many ‘no-shows’ you get each hour
for pre-booked exhibitions to your museums. You use this model to help
you decide how many extra tickets you can sell at the door. At some
point, your model’s predictions are often wrong and you are frequently
overcapacity in the exhibition space.</p>
<p>After a few days of trying to dig into what is happening, you realise
that your museum now has a mobile app it didn’t previously have. This
app is being used by many people to buy tickets a few minutes before the
exhibition to avoid queuing. Digging into the data you can see that
currently the average time a ticket is purchased before a timed
exhibition visit is an hour. Looking back at your original training data
the average time was 3 days before. The models training data is
different from the ‘real world’ in which we ask the model to make
predictions. In this case, the change was quite obvious but you could
think of other changes which could impact this model, the season in
which the training data came from, the price of exhibition tickets
etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Monitoring predictions</strong>: if you plan to use your
model on an ongoing basis it may be helpful to monitor the predictions
it makes. If you notice a big shift in the distribution of labels being
predicted over time you may want to investigate if this is because of a
change in the data being shown to the model. This may not always be
possible to do automatically. So sometimes human checks may be more
practical.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping a human in the loop</strong>: In an earlier section,
we discussed how the predictions made by machine learning models could
be used in a variety of ways. Some of these involved a human checking or
using the model’s prediction. This approach will be likely to help you
spot issues with models predictions. Even if you are using the model’s
predictions to make automated changes you may still want to ’insert a
human into the loop to check these predictions fairly regularly. This
may also be an important stage in developing buy-in for machine learning
based approaches within an institution.</p>
<p><strong>Retraining a model</strong>: in some situations a model won’t
just be trained once. You may want to retrain the model when the type of
data changes or you have more training data that can be used. One
typical example of this kind of process is models which predict some
metrics for each quarter. After that quarter has passed you will have
‘ground truth’ data available that you will likely want to use in your
model. Another source of training data might be generated by having a
human in the loop. If a model is showing predictions to a human who can
accept or reject these predictions this gives you additional examples
your model can learn from.</p>

<li>Machine learning projects involve many considerations beyond
training a model.</li>
<li>The predictions made by the same machine learning model can be
‘translated’ into actions in different ways. The extent to which you
‘automate’ decisions versus keeping a ‘human-in-the-loop’ will depend on
the problem you are tackling, your organization and your model’s
performance.</li>
<li>The use of Machine learning by GLAMs is relatively new. Sharing
results and lessons learned will likely help GLAMS realize the potential
benefits of machine learning.</li>

<p><strong>Training Data</strong> \ # TODO possibly chop if covered
elsewhere</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Why?</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Training data is time-consuming to produce and others may be able to
reuse or build on your data</li>
<li>Being able to interrogate the data used to train a model may help
give insights into the limitations of any models based on this data</li>
<li>Having shared datasets makes it easier for people to establish what
is reasonable performance to expect for a particular model/task because
they can compare results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Possible approach?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Share in an existing data repository</li>
<li>Include a clear license to indicate terms of use</li>
<li>Include documentation about how the dataset was constructed. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010f" class="external-link"><em>Datasheets for
datasets</em></a> offers a useful template for approaching this
documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Models</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Why?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is likely that a lot of work went into creating this model and it
is possible others could also benefit from this model</li>
<li>Training some machine learning models has a large environmental
impact. Sharing models can help this environmental cost being occurred
multiple times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Possible approach?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on how you are using your model’s predictions the model
itself might be contained inside an ‘application’. This application
could be shared directly or you might decide to share the model
weights.</li>
<li>It is important to document your model. The original intended use,
limitations and a link to the training data will all help enabel people
to evaluate how they could use your model. <a href="https://arxiv.org/ct?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1145%2F3287560.3287596&amp;v=b782538f" class="external-link"><em>Model
Cards for Model Reporting</em></a> provides guidance for what this
documentation should include.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Processes, successes and failures</strong> beyond sharing the
more tangible outcomes of a machine learning project documenting the
broader project will help other GLAM institutions apply machine
learning. This documentation could include;</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem you were trying to solve</li>
<li>Alternatives to machine learning considered</li>
<li>How you created your training data</li>
<li>The metrics which were important to you</li>
<li>The models you considered</li>
<li>The experiments you ran and the results of those experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various ways in which this work can be documented. Academic
papers are a possible avenue for sharing the results of experiments but
should not be considered as the ‘sole’ medium for sharing meaningful
work. The format of many academic journals is likely to preclude sharing
‘failed’ projects and it may be challenging to publish more ‘modest’
uses of machine learning because they are deemed to lack ‘novelty’.</p>
<p>Beyond academic papers, there are a growing number of tools for
managing machine learning projects which include data versioning,
experiment tracking and other features for documenting work. Public
version control repository like GitHub or GitLab offer venus for sharing
code and you may explore using other tools like Jupyter notebooks to
help make your models more accessible to others.</p>
